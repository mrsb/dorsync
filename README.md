dorsync
=======

Used by Mageia QA team to sync pre-release ISOs, perform md5sum & sha1sum
checks and dump them to a USB stick.

Fill in the few details at the beginning of the script before use.

ToDo:

- Show which ISOs have been updated and confirm before sync
- Add a GUI - may need porting to python/perl
- Display available ISOs
- Enable user to select a number of ISOs to sync and remember settings for re-sync
